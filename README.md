# Nori

## What is Nori?
A simple, low-fuss, lightweight foundation for building 2D and 3D geometry and engineering applications. The goal is to eventually include all of these:

- 2D & 3D geometry primitives
- Basic trignometry, compuational geometry algorithms
- 2D Entities suitable to read in drawings (points, polygons, text ...)
- 3D Entities suitable to read in models (curves, surfaces ...)
- Kinematics and simulation support
- I/O for basic 2D and 3D filetypes: DXF, GEO, IGS, STEP
- Rendering using an OpenGL engine (with a simple scene-graph interface)

## Design goals
- All code written with modern C#, refactored often to keep technical debt down
- Good test coverage for all code
- Clean layering of core / operations / UI
- High performance
- Elegant, clean, well documented code
